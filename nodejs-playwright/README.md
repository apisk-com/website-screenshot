# Website screenshot API with Node.js and Playwright

A small HTTP service that takes a screenshot of a web page from its URL and
returns a PNG, JPEG or WebP image. It uses Express 5 and one shared Chromium
browser from Playwright, with a new browser context for each request. It can
also save the image in Amazon S3 or Cloudflare R2. The tutorial explains each
file: [Build a Website Screenshot API with Node.js and Playwright](https://apisk.com/blog/screenshot-api-nodejs/).

## Requirements

- Node.js 22 or later
- Chromium for Playwright 1.65 (the install step downloads it)
- Docker, only for the container

## Install

```bash
npm ci
```

```bash
npx playwright install --only-shell chromium
```

On Linux, add `--with-deps` to the second command to install the system libraries.

## Run

```bash
API_KEY=change-me npm start
```

The service listens on port 3000. Set `PORT` to use a different port. If
`API_KEY` is not set, the service accepts requests without a key.

## Example request

Start the local test page in a second terminal:

```bash
npm run test-page
```

Then get a 1200 x 630 WebP screenshot of it:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer change-me" -o preview.webp "http://localhost:3000/screenshot?url=http://127.0.0.1:8080/&width=1200&height=630&format=webp"
```

## Parameters of GET /screenshot

| Parameter | Values | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `url` | An `http://` or `https://` URL, at most 2048 characters | required |
| `width` | Viewport width in CSS pixels, 320 to 1920 | 1280 |
| `height` | Viewport height in CSS pixels, 240 to 1920 | 800 |
| `scale` | Device scale factor, 0.25 to 3 | 1 |
| `format` | `png`, `jpeg` or `webp` | `png` |
| `quality` | 1 to 100, only for `jpeg` and `webp` | 80 |
| `fullPage` | `true` or `false`; the image stops at 10000 CSS pixels | `false` |
| `store` | `true` saves the image in S3 and returns JSON | `false` |

Answers: 200 with the image, 201 with `{ "bucket", "key" }` for `store=true`,
400 for bad input, 401 for a missing or wrong key, 502 when the page does not
load or answers with status 400 or higher, 503 when too many screenshots run,
504 when the page is too slow. For a page that answers 403, the body is
`{ "error": "The page answered with status 403.", "targetStatus": 403 }`.

The service waits for `DOMContentLoaded`, then at most 5 seconds until the
network is idle. A page that never stops loading still gets its screenshot.

The service accepts only `http:` and `https:` URLs, but it does not block
private network addresses. Before you open it to other people, add SSRF
protection (SSRF: server-side request forgery).

## Environment variables

| Variable | Use |
|---|---|
| `PORT` | HTTP port, default 3000 |
| `API_KEY` | Key that clients send as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` |
| `RENDER_TIMEOUT_MS` | Time limit for page load and for the screenshot, default 15000 |
| `NETWORK_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` | Longest wait for an idle network after the HTML loads, default 5000 |
| `MAX_OPEN_CONTEXTS` | Screenshots at the same time, default 4; more get status 503 |
| `CHROMIUM_SANDBOX` | `false` turns off the Chromium sandbox; use it only for pages you trust |
| `S3_BUCKET` | Turns on `store=true` and names the bucket |
| `S3_REGION` | Bucket region; default `auto` for Cloudflare R2 |
| `S3_ENDPOINT` | For R2: `https://<account id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com` |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Storage credentials |

## Test

```bash
npm test
```

The tests start Chromium, a local test page server and the service, and
check real images. `test.sh` is the CI script: it also builds the Docker
image and sends requests to the container.

## Docker

```bash
docker build -t screenshot-api-nodejs .
```

```bash
docker run --init --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN -p 3000:3000 -e API_KEY=change-me screenshot-api-nodejs
```

`--init` stops the Chromium child processes. `--cap-add=SYS_ADMIN` lets
Chromium start its sandbox as the non-root user `pwuser`.
